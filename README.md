![Netflix Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Netflix_logo.svg)

This project explores the factors influencing movie scores and popularity using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to predict movie scores and develop a personalized recommendation system based on content similarity.

## üöÄ Objectives

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand trends in movies based on their genres, languages, and popularity over time.
- **Score Prediction**: Use Machine Learning models to predict movie scores.
- **Personalized Recommendation**: Build a recommendation system based on the similarity of descriptions and genres.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Main Libraries**:
  - Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `RandomForest`
  - Text Processing: `TfidfVectorizer`, `CountVectorizer`
- **Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (GBM)
  - LightGBM
  - XGBoost

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Score Distribution**: Analyze average scores by genre.
2. **Popularity and Trends**:
   - Evolution of movie count over the decades.
   - Impact of popularity and vote count on movie scores.
3. **Genre Analysis**:
   - Distribution of movies by genre and language.
   - Correlations between variables (popularity, scores, etc.).
4. **Word Clouds**:
   - Main genres.
   - Movie descriptions.

## ü§ñ Modeling

### Models Tested:
- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model to capture linear relationships.
- **Ridge and Lasso**: Regularization techniques to avoid overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: A powerful model for capturing complex non-linear relationships.
- **Gradient Boosting (GBM)**: Captures non-linear relationships effectively.
- **XGBoost & LightGBM**: Advanced models for better accuracy and speed.

### Model Results (Best Score):
- **LightGBM**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.2574
  - R¬≤: 0.5619
- **XGBoost**:
  - MSE: 0.2755
  - R¬≤: 0.5311

## üéØ Recommendation System

The system uses content similarity based on:
- Movie descriptions (`TfidfVectorizer`).
- Associated genres (`CountVectorizer`).

Example recommendations for the movie _"The Godfather"_:
1. The Godfather
2. The Godfather: Part II
3. Blood Ties
4. Joker
5. Bomb City
